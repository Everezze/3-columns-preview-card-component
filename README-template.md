## Overview

The challenge is to build out this 3-column preview card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible. Any tool is allowed to build it.
### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

### Screenshot

Here's the layout in tablet format. I thought I can let it like that, maybe centering the content ??

And there is the Layout in desktop format.

## My process

As always structuring the content with HTML on paper, thinking how much tags I need in every part of the project in order to set up some re-usable styles. Then adding the CSS. No need here for dynamic interactions with JS.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS3 with BEM notation
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  outline: white solid 2px;
}
```
### Continued development

Continuing with flexbox, and also trying to tam the behaviour of box-sizing: border-box; property.
Also just overall trying to place elements with the natural flow of css and not trying to go against it.
